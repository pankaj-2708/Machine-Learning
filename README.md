# 🧠 Machine Learning with CampusX

This repository contains my hands-on practice and projects while learning Machine Learning through the CampusX YouTube course.

## 📚 About the Course

The [CampusX ML Course](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusX) is a free, beginner-friendly series that teaches core machine learning concepts using Python and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.


## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pankaj-2708/Machine-Learning.git
   cd machine-learning-campusx
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📌 Notes

- All notebooks include detailed explanations, visualizations, and scratch implementations wherever possible.
- Datasets used are small and meant for learning purposes.

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Add mini-projects based on learned concepts
- Deploy models using Streamlit or Flask
- Try Kaggle datasets using learned techniques

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

- Thanks to [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusX) for the excellent content.
- Inspired by the goal to learn ML deeply by implementing everything from scratch.
